# House-Price-Prediction

Hi everyone, welcome to my repo. I have built **House Price Prediction** system for predicting current and future price of the house. It also consists of Custom Recommendation Algorithm Logic, Google Maps API, Real Time Filters using AJAX. Hope you like it :)

The system makes use of Flask and FlaskMySQLDB for backend processing and connection.

## How to get it running on your system ?

1. Download the source code
2. Install and switch to virtualenv on your machine (optional)
3. Install the requirements file ( **Python version 3.8.0 preferred** )
4. Create a database named house_price_prediction(any other name is also fine, but don't forget to make changes in code) and import smart_buy.sql (located inside Dataset folder) file in your MySQL client
5. Change app.config settings according to your MySQL configuration
6. Run the main.py file (CMD command - `python main.py`)
7. Put the localhost address with port no 5000 in any of the browser on your machine `localhost:5000`
